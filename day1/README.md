# Day 1
## Retreiving a structure

We will take the skc1 gene from *Streptomyces lividans* coding for a potassium channel protein as a toy exaple. 
First let's look to the [genomic sequence from GenBank.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/Z37969)
If you explore the file you will find a cross reference to the Uniprot database. We can use it to reach the entry in the [Uniprot database](https://www.uniprot.org/). 


* What is the name of the protein encoded by skc1 gene.
* Find the structure section, how many structures are available for this protein ?
* Can you check if the entire protein's structure is solved ?

We are now going to the [RCSB](https://www.rcsb.org/) web page (The protein databank). Let us use the PDB code [1BL8](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1BL8) in the search field to access to the structure. 

Click the download file button then select "PDB format" to download the file.

* Extract the first chain of the structure in an independant file. 

Verify if the sequence of the chain is the same as the protein in the Uniprot entry. We hace first to convert the data in the PDB file to get the sequence. We can use the [WhatIF server](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/servers/html/soupir.html). We then align the sequence to the Uniprot entry using [EMBOSS needle server](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/emboss_needle/).


## NMR structures
In the same manner as before download the struture of [Charybdotoxin](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2crd). 

* What is the Uniprot identifier of the peptide.
*  Try to identify the constructing blocks of the file. 
*  Extract the sequence from the PDB file and compare it to the sequence from the metadada (use ), again using [WhatIF server](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/servers/html/soupir.html) and [EMBOSS needle server](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/emboss_needle/).
