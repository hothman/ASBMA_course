## Case 1: 
Download the structure of Lamin A (PDB code:1IFR). Mutate the residue R527 by an Asn. Choose the right rotamer and refine with chimera using a tw stages of energy minimization. 

What can be the consequence of this mutation ? 
Use the [SDM](http://marid.bioc.cam.ac.uk/sdm2/) to help you in the analysis.

## Case 2
Bacteriorhodopsin is a protein used by Archaea acting as a proton pump to produce chemical energy (ATP). 
Download only the chain B of Bacteriorhodopsin using PyMOL `(fetch 1S51_B)`.  Clean the structure and mutate residue P91 to Gly. Choose the right rotamer and refine with chimera using a tw stages of energy minimization. 
Can you predict the impact of the mutation. 

## Case 3 
MMP-2 is an extracellular matrix implicated mainly in collagenolysis. Download the structure of the catalytic domain 3AYU. Mutate His 124 with Arg. Choose the best rotamer. Pull you interpretations, this time without refining the structure.

## Case 4
UNC119 is involved in synaptic functions in photoreceptor cells. Download the structure of 3RBQ (CHain C only). Again, we are not going to refine the structure prior to the analysis.

## Case 5 
Glucocorticoid receptor is a transcription factor which binds to a specific
DNA sequence.
* Download the structure 3G6P.
* Create three objects in pymol: DNA, WT and Mut.
* Mutate the Arg 496 tu Asp on both chains for the object Mut.
* Refine the structure and generate the electrostatic map.
